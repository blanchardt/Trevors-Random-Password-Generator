# Random Password Generator  
Modify the starter code for a password generator.

## Project Description
The page is set up so that a user can press a button and be prompted with some questions.  It will then create a  random password 
based off the prompts the user gave.  Once the password is created it will populate the box in the center of the screen with the 
created password.
